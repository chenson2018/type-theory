# type-theory
A repository for code written as I explore type theory. 

## Pie

I recently finished reading [The Little Typer](https://thelittletyper.com/). I am starting my journey into type theory by using the language Pie that the book constructs, trying some very basic proofs on my own.

## Agda

I just started reading [Programming Language Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/). I'll be doing at least some of the exercises.
